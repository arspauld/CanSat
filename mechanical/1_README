First of all, when modifying parts please let everyone know so that multiple people do not end up modifying the same part and then 
  trying to upload completely different versions of the same part.

Second: to open the parts/assemblies make sure you pull the latest stuff from github then open creo and navigate to the github 
  on your computer.  You should be able to edit and save everything inside that folder and then just push it back to github to 
  update everything.

Third: the naming of the parts/assemblies is as follows:
  Main assembly: 2018-cssf-000.asm
  Chassis assembly: 2018-cssf-100.asm
  Gimbal assembly: 2018-cssf-200.asm
  Dual rotor assembly: 2018-cssf-300.asm
  Single rotor assembly: 2018-cssf-300b.asm
  Release mechanism: 2018-cssf-400.asm
  
  The parts are named by what assembly they belong to, for example the standoffs on the chassis are named 2018-cssf-102.prt becasue
  they were the second part I created for the chassis assembly.
  
  The version number is the last digits after the file type, i.e. 2018-cssf.asm.19 is the 19th version of the main assembly.  The 
  larger numbers are the latest versions. But we shouldn't have to worry about version numbers for most of what we'll be doing.
  
  I'm going to make a changelog/note file under the mechanical folder so whenever a change is made please put the date and 
  describe what you changed.
