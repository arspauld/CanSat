First of all, when modifying parts please let everyone know so that multiple people do not end up modifying the same part and then 
  trying to upload completely different versions.

Second (note this is just the way I THINK it will work, don't know for sure): to open the assembly, clone the mechanical folder to 
  your computer and open the latest version of the main assembly.  When you're done modifying parts take the latest version of each
  part you modified and upload it to github. (If anyone knows this will/won't work let me know)

Third: the naming of the parts/assemblies is as follows:
  Main assembly: 2018-cssf-000.asm
  Chassis assembly: 2018-cssf-100.asm
  Gimbal assembly: 2018-cssf-200.asm
  Lower rotor: 2018-cssf-300.asm
  Upper rotor: 2018-cssf-300b.asm
  Release mechanism: 2018-cssf-400.asm
  
  The parts are named by what assembly they belong to, for example the standoffs on the chassis are named 2018-cssf-102.prt becasue
  they were the second part I created for the chassis assembly.
  
  The version number is the last digits after the file type, i.e. 2018-cssf.asm.19 is the 19th version of the main assembly.  The 
  larger numbers are the latest versions.
  
  I'm going to make a changelog/note file under the mechanical folder so whenever a change is made please put the date and 
  describe what you changed.
